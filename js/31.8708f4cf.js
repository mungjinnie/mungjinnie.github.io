Therefore, it is necessary to identify the design implications and the role of AI in incorporating fashion designers’ style subjectivity into a decision-making support tool. We interviewed six fashion professionals about their current practice of defining style, how the defined style is applied in the design process, and the challenges that they face in the design process. Based on the interview findings, we identified the following three challenges in defining style and the design process based on the style.

We also employed the k-means algorithm to allow users to quickly explore and create their own style board that incorporates brand identity, trends, and user preferences (Pick). In CoDesign, we used StyleGAN2 to generate images that are consistent with the style board and different from existing designs (Create). We also implemented StyleGAN2-based style mixing, interpolation, and attribute editing to integrate the fashion designer’s unique style (Switch). In CoImprovement, we used Transformer embedding vectors to recommend images based on overall looks and the style board (View). Additionally, we employed an attribute detection model to recommend images based on attributes and the style board (Fit). From this, designers can easily think of various ways to improve designs that also fit with the style board.

With the continuous development of AI, AI-CST has been proposed as a possible way to foster each individual’s creativity characteristics. Therefore, it is important to investigate the key components of AI- CST that provide a better user experience by considering creativity types according to the design process. Through the user study, we confirmed that there were clear differences in the use and perception of the AI-CST depending on the type of creativity based on the survey responses, system usage logs, and interviews. We discussed how the AI-CST should be designed to accommodate both types of creativity to make the use of AI-based systems more flexible and efficient. </p></div><div class="container3" style="margin:10px 0px 30px 0px;"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer" style="width:80%;"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/COCO1.png" class="Pprojectimage4"><p class="Pprojecttext">The designs produced by adaptors and innovators.</p></div></div>',2),d=(0,i.Lk)("div",{class:"Projectdescription",style:{margin:"10px 0px 0px 0px"}},[(0,i.Lk)("h1",{class:"ProjectTitle",style:{margin:"25px 0px 25px 0px"}},"Publications"),(0,i.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"[To be appeared] Understanding the Differences in an AI-based Creativity Support Tool Between Creativity Types in Fashion Design"),(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperAuthors"},[(0,i.Lk)("span",{class:"PaperName"},"Myungjin Kim"),(0,i.eW)(", Misun Joo, Kyungsik Han")]),(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference"},"Taylor & Francis International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction"),(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"PdfLink"},[(0,i.Lk)("span",{style:{cursor:"pointer","text-decoration":"underline"},OnClick:"window.open('https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/Understanding_the_Differences.pdf', '_blank')"},"PDF")])]),(0,i.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"CoCoStyle: Mixed Initiative Co-Creative System to Support Creative Process of Fashion Design"),(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperAuthors"},[(0,i.Lk)("span",{class:"PaperName"},"Myungjin Kim"),(0,i.eW)(", Misun Joo, Kyungsik Han")]),(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference"},"Elsevier SoftwareX"),(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"PdfLink"},[(0,i.Lk)("span",{style:{cursor:"pointer","text-decoration":"underline"},OnClick:"window.open('https://astlyi.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/2024/%5B123%5DCoCoStyle.pdf', '_blank')"},"PDF")])]),(0,i.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"Reflecting Subjectivity of Style to Support Decision Making Process for Fashion Designers"),(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperAuthors"},[(0,i.Lk)("span",{class:"PaperName"},"Myungjin Kim"),(0,i.eW)(", Misun Joo, Kyungsik Han")]),(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference"},"Journal of the HCI Society of Korea "),(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"PdfLink"},[(0,i.Lk)("span",{style:{cursor:"pointer","text-decoration":"underline"},OnClick:"window.open('https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/HCIKorea.pdf', '_blank')"},"PDF")])]),(0,i.Lk)("h1",{class:"ProjectTitle",style:{margin:"25px 0px 25px 0px"}},"Patents"),(0,i.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"Interacting with fashion image analysis, recommendation, and generation AI technology to support the fashion design process (Filed, 10-2023-0188413)"),(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{margin:"0px 0px 30px 0px"}},"Patents")]),(0,i.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"AI Software Supporting Fashion Designer Creativity (Filed, C-2024-004375)"),(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{margin:"0px 0px 30px 0px"}},"Software")])],-1),p=[o,a,r,d];function l(e,t,s,o,a,r){return(0,i.uX)(),(0,i.CE)("div",n,p)}var c=s(3497),h=s.n(c),y={name:"MyProjectsdetail4",components:{},props:{msg:String},setup(){(0,i.sV)((()=>{h().init()}))}},u=s(1241);const g=(0,u.A)(y,[["render",l]]);var f=g}}]);
