Understanding log patterns in relation to depression levels could provide additional quantitative indicators for clinics. This could aid in more accurate depression diagnoses and allow for recommending effective app usage strategies to alleviate symptoms at various stages of depression. <br><br>Based on these motivation, we aim to answer the following research question: <br> - Does the severity of depression symptoms reflect differences in app content usage logs? <br><br>To answer these questions, from the &#39;Mind Health&#39; mobile app, designed to ease the symptoms for Korea&#39;s growing depression patient population, we analyzed data from <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">351 Seoul-based users</span>, aged 20 to 30, who are experiencing depression. This allowed us to understand the usage patterns according to the degrees of depression (severe, moderate, mild) and to suggest design strategies for the app that could better aid in alleviating depression. </p><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">Mind Health Contents</h1></div><div class="container3_" style="margin:30px 0px 0px 0px;"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer_"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/mental1.png" class="Pprojectimage3"><p class="Pprojecttext">Workout: After choosing a background for walking or running, users orient their smartphone cameras towards themselves.

Furthermore, Tukey's post-hoc analysis showed significant differences between the mild and severe groups (p < 0.05), as well as between the mild and average groups (p < 0.05).
