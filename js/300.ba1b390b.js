This app categorizes users&#39; depression levels as severe, moderate, or mild based on the CESD-10-D score. We analyzed differences in app usage based on depression levels using data from 351 Seoul-based users, aged 20 to 30, who were experiencing depression. </span></p></div><div class="Projectdescription" style="margin:60px 0px 0px 0px;"><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">Mind Health Contents</h1></div><div class="container3_" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer_"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/mental1.png" class="Pprojectimage3"><p class="Pprojecttext"><span style="font-weight:400;">Workout: After choosing a background for walking or running, users orient their smartphone cameras towards themselves. The app then blends user image with the selected background. Next, the user performs a walking or running gesture. While the user walks or runs, the app tracks the activity&#39;s performance rate.</span></p></div></div><div class="container3_"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer_"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/mental2.png" class="Pprojectimage3"><p class="Pprojecttext"><span style="font-weight:400;">Finding Blue: Measures the ability for &#39;cognitive control&#39; to filter out distracting information, &#39;sensitivity&#39; towards receiving positive or negative social feedback, and &#39;depression&#39; through words associated with emotional words.</span></p></div></div><div class="container3_"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer_"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/mental3.png" class="Pprojectimage3"><p class="Pprojecttext"><span style="font-weight:400;">Digital Mandala: Users begin by selecting a mandala design to color, then fill it with their chosen colors.

Significant differences in usage frequency were observed across these groups (t(68) = -2.88, p &lt; 0.05). Similarly, notable differences in time spent using the content were identified between the groups (t(68) = 2.78, p &lt; 0.05). Considering that the group with moderate depression levels showed higher performance rates compared to the mild group, individuals with moderate depression are more likely to actively use the app to alleviate their symptoms.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight:600;">Finding Blue:</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">Users with severe depression received an average performance score of 46 in Finding Blue, while those with average depression scored 44, and the mild depression group scored an average of 25. ANOVA analysis revealed significant differences in performance scores across these groups, (F(2,135) = 6.49, p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, Tukey&#39;s post-hoc analysis showed significant differences between the mild and severe groups (p &lt; 0.05), as well as between the mild and average groups (p &lt; 0.05). This suggests that the mild depression group outperformed the others in cognitive control, sensitivity to social evaluation, and avoidance reactivity.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight:600;">Digital Mandala:</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">We compared the completion rates and time spent across groups using digital mandalas. However, we found no significant differences, indicating that digital mandalas are not effective in distinguishing between different levels of depression severity. Therefore, it seems necessary to diversify the complexity of the mandala patterns to enhance the content.</span></p></div><div class="Projectdescription" style="margin:60px 0px 0px 0px;"><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">Impact</h1><p class="PTexts"><span style="font-weight:400;"> This allowed us to understand the usage patterns according to the three levels of depression: severe, moderate, and mild.
