We interviewed six fashion professionals about the real-life processes, challenges, and possible solutions at each stage. <br><br>We found a key challenge in each of the three design processes, and based on these, three design goals were established: <br> - The need to find images that contain the designer’s perspectives, brand identity, and trends. <br> - The need to provide an image inspiration that differentiates between an existing design and the designer’s past design. <br> - The need to improved references without deviating from the mood initially set.</p><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">System Development</h1><p class="PTexts">Based on these design goals, we developed CoFashion (Co-Create Fashion) which has a total of three processes. We finetuned <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">StyleGAN2</span> and <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">Transformer</span> with 40,000 fashion image dataset collected from Vogue.com. To extract 46 fashion categories and 294 fashion design attributes, we used attribute detection model Swin-B as the backbone to train the attribute Mask R-CNN using the Fashionpedia dataset. </p></div><div class="container3" style="margin:50px 0px 0px 0px;"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/CoCoStyle1.png" class="Pprojectimage"><p class="Pprojecttext">The user constrains a baseline to form a style board and selects designer own mood board.</p></div><div class="Psubprojectcontainer"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/CoCoStyle2.png" class="Pprojectimage"><p class="Pprojecttext">The user generates an image based on the style board and adjusts the generated image.</p></div><div class="Psubprojectcontainer"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/CoCoStyle3.png" class="Pprojectimage"><p class="Pprojecttext">The user obtains improvement directions based on the style board and the attribute.</p></div></div><div class="Projectdescription" style="margin:60px 0px 0px 0px;"><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">User Study &amp; Data Analysis</h1><p class="PTexts">We conducted a user study with a total of <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">30 participants</span>, including fashion designers working in fashion companies or students majoring in fashion.

It focuses on <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">identifying pain points and addressing the fashion industry&#39;s challenges using AI</span>. Unlike traditional developer-focused AI research, our goal is to create <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">human-centered AI that professionals can apply in their daily work</span>. We are developing comprehensive extensive fashion data analysis tools for fashion professionals, dashboard services that can capture fashion trends rapidly, and APIs that offer personalized product recommendations and style analysis through the users&#39; social media outfit posts. <br><br> <span style="font-weight:500;">Key Responsibilities</span><br> - Developed an API for extracting color attributes from fashion images using the U2NET and color extract Python module <br> - Developed an API for generating fake images by fine-tuning StyleGAN2 with a dataset of 40,000 fashion images crawled from Vogue. <br> - Developed an API for style trend analysis using the algorithm that received the highest satisfaction from users for clustering styles and analyzing trends. <br> - Developed a crawling API that continuously collects data on newly updated fashion products. <br> - Designed interface that provides a unified look to dashboard components and shapes, enhancing user experience and actively incorporating user feedback. <br> - Designed a exhibition booth that aligns with the MOS brand identity and captures attention. </p></div><div class="container3" style="margin:50px 0px 0px 0px;"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/MOS1.png" class="Pprojectimage"></div><div class="Psubprojectcontainer"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/MOS2.png" class="Pprojectimage"></div></div>',5),o=(0,t.Lk)("div",{class:"Projectdescription",style:{margin:"10px 0px 0px 0px"}},[(0,t.Lk)("h1",{class:"ProjectTitle",style:{margin:"25px 0px 25px 0px"}},"Publications"),(0,t.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"Under Review: Understanding the Differences in an AI Mixed Initiative Co-Creative System Between Creativity Types in Fashion Design"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperAuthors"},[(0,t.Lk)("span",{class:"PaperName"},"Myungjin Kim"),(0,t.eW)(", Misun Joo, Kyungsik Han")]),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{margin:"0px 0px 30px 0px"}},"CSCW 2024: ACM International Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing")]),(0,t.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"Under Review: CoCoStyle: Mixed Initiative Co-Creative System to Support Creative Process of Fashion Design"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperAuthors"},[(0,t.Lk)("span",{class:"PaperName"},"Myungjin Kim"),(0,t.eW)(", Misun Joo, Kyungsik Han")]),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{margin:"0px 0px 30px 0px"}},"SoftwareX")]),(0,t.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"A Study on User Perception and Experience Differences in Recommendation Results by Domain Expertise: The case of Fashion Domains"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperAuthors"},[(0,t.eW)("Taehyung Noh, Haein Yeo, "),(0,t.Lk)("span",{class:"PaperName"},"Myungjin Kim"),(0,t.eW)(", Kyungsik Han")]),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference"},"CHI LBW 2023: ACM International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PdfLink"},[(0,t.Lk)("span",{style:{cursor:"pointer","text-decoration":"underline"},OnClick:"location.href='https://astlyi.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/2023/%5B99%5DA+Study+on+User+Perception+and+Experience+Differences+in+Recommendation+Results+by+Domain+Expertise.pdf'"},"PDF")])]),(0,t.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"CoFashion: An AI Web Interface Enhancing Creative Thinking for Fashion Designers"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperAuthors",style:{top:"18px"}},[(0,t.eW)("Misun Joo, "),(0,t.Lk)("span",{class:"PaperName"},"Myungjin Kim"),(0,t.eW)(", Bogoan Kim, Kyungsik Han")]),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{top:"37px"}},"Korea Software Congress 2023"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PdfLink"},[(0,t.Lk)("span",{style:{cursor:"pointer","text-decoration":"underline"},OnClick:"location.href='https://astlyi.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/2023/%5BD-35%5DCoFashion.pdf'"},"PDF")])]),(0,t.Lk)("h1",{class:"ProjectTitle",style:{margin:"25px 0px 25px 0px"}},"Awards & Accomplishments"),(0,t.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"2022 Best Inventor award"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{margin:"0px 0px 30px 0px"}},"Seoul International Invention Fair")]),(0,t.Lk)("h1",{class:"ProjectTitle",style:{margin:"25px 0px 25px 0px"}},"Patents"),(0,t.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"Interacting with fashion image analysis, recommendation, and generation AI technology to support the fashion design process (Filed, 10-2023-0188413)"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{margin:"0px 0px 30px 0px"}},"Patents")]),(0,t.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"AI Software Supporting Fashion Designer Creativity (Filed, C-2024-004375)"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{margin:"0px 0px 30px 0px"}},"Software")])],-1),r=[i,o];function p(e,s,a,i,o,p){return(0,t.uX)(),(0,t.CE)("div",n,r)}var c=a(3497),l=a.n(c),d={name:"MyProjectsdetail4",components:{},props:{msg:String},setup(){(0,t.sV)((()=>{l().init()}))}},h=a(1241);const g=(0,h.A)(d,[["render",p]]);var u=g}}]);
