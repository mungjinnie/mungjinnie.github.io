This allowed us to understand the usage patterns according to the degrees of depression (severe, moderate, mild) and to suggest design strategies for the app that could better aid in alleviating depression. </span></p></div><div class="Projectdescription" style="margin:60px 0px 0px 0px;"><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">Mind Health Contents</h1></div><div class="container3_" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer_"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/mental1.png" class="Pprojectimage3"><p class="Pprojecttext"><span style="font-weight:400;">Workout: After choosing a background for walking or running, users orient their smartphone cameras towards themselves.

There were significant differences in usage across these groups (t(68) = -2.88, p &lt; 0.05). Similarly, for the time spent using the content, notable differences were observed between the groups (t(68) = 2.78, p &lt; 0.05). We found that the group with average depression levels had higher performance rates compared to the mild group, suggesting that those with average depression are more likely to use the app actively to alleviate their symptoms.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight:600;">Finding Blue:</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">Users with severe depression received an average score of 46 in Finding Blue, while those with average depression scored 44, and the mild depression group scored an average of 25, which was notably lower by comparison. ANOVA analysis revealed significant differences across these groups, F(2,135) = 6.49 (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, Tukey&#39;s post-hoc analysis showed significant differences between the mild and severe groups (p &lt; 0.05), as well as between the mild and average groups (p &lt; 0.05). This suggests that the mild depression group outperformed the others in cognitive control, sensitivity to social evaluation, and avoidance reactivity.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight:600;">Digital Mandala:</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">We compared the completion rates and time spent across groups using digital mandalas. However, we found no significant differences, indicating that digital mandalas are not effective in distinguishing between different levels of depression severity. Therefore, it seems necessary to diversify the complexity of the mandala patterns to enhance the content.</span></p></div><div class="Projectdescription" style="margin:50px 0px 0px 0px;"><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">Key Responsibilities</h1><p class="PTexts"><span style="font-weight:400;"> - Developed an app log data analysis API for processing data accumulated at two-week intervals. <br> - Prepared biweekly data analysis reports. <br> - Analyzed data from 351 participants and led the paper writing process from draft to publication. </span></p></div>',7),o=(0,a.Lk)("div",{class:"Projectdescription",style:{margin:"10px 0px 0px 0px"}},[(0,a.Lk)("h1",{class:"ProjectTitle"},"Publications"),(0,a.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,a.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"[In Korean] Relationship between Depression Level and Mental Health App Activity Log"),(0,a.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperAuthors",style:{top:"18px"}},[(0,a.Lk)("span",{class:"PaperName"},"Myungjin Kim"),(0,a.eW)(", Kyungsik Han")]),(0,a.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{top:"37px"}},"HCI Korea 2023"),(0,a.Lk)("p",{class:"Award",style:{top:"55px"}},[(0,a.Lk)("span",{style:{"background-color":"#E5ECF1"}},"BEST PAPER AWARD")]),(0,a.Lk)("p",{class:"PdfLink"},[(0,a.Lk)("span",{style:{cursor:"pointer","text-decoration":"underline"},OnClick:"window.open('https://astlyi.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/2023/%5BD-30%5DHCIK_Mental.pdf', '_blank')"},"PDF")])])],-1),r=[n,o];function p(e,t,s,n,o,p){return(0,a.uX)(),(0,a.CE)("div",i,r)}var l=s(3497),c=s.n(l),d={name:"MyProjectsdetail3",components:{},props:{msg:String},setup(){(0,a.sV)((()=>{c().init()}))}},h=s(1241);const g=(0,h.A)(d,[["render",p]]);var m=g}}]);
