Designersâ€™ initial design ideas often begin as uncertain and abstract mental images. This vagueness allows for multiple interpretations of the design, such as providing a rich array of design strategies, fostering the transformation of ideas, and preventing early fixation that limits creativity to pre-existing concepts. However, when vagueness becomes too excessive, it can lead to scattered or directionless results due to the lack of clear constraints in the design development process. Therefore, effective management of vagueness---within its appropriate range, which tends to vary from person to person---is crucial to the success of a project <br><br> <span style="font-weight:500;">Key Responsibilities</span><br><br> - Conducted a formative study with 6 designers and set design goals. <br> - Developed the CLAY, an interactive system leveraging text-to-image Generative AI prompting method. <br> - Conducted a user study with 10 fashion designers to evaluate the effectiveness of CLAY. <br> - Derived meaningful findings from log, survey, and interview data and suggested design implications. <br> - Led the paper writing process from draft to publication. </p><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">System Description</h1><p class="PTexts">The user starts by composing a &quot;vague prompt,&quot; which reduces the pressure to enter detailed prompts (DG3). Next, they explore the hierarchical keyword results generated by the text-to-image generative AI, using the vagueness to explore various possibilities (DG1). The user then refines the prompt using the keywords provided by CLAY, avoiding being overwhelmed by unintended hierarchical results (DG2), and receiving assistance in specifying prompts (DG3). Next, CLAY generated the results from the keyword user input, which helps reduce vagueness (DG1). This framework supports the balancing of vagueness across four stages. These phases are applied to both the moodboard and the design process. </p></div><div class="container3" style="margin:50px 0px 0px 0px;"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer" style="width:90%;"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/CLAY1.png" class="Pprojectimage4"><p class="Pprojecttext">The main process structure of CLAY consists of four stages.</p></div></div><div class="container3" style="margin:50px 0px 0px 0px;"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer" style="width:90%;"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/CLAY2.png" class="Pprojectimage4"><p class="Pprojecttext">The flow of CLAY&#39;s four main structures as applied to the moodboard and design process.</p></div></div>',3),r=(0,i.Lk)("div",{class:"Projectdescription",style:{margin:"50px 0px 0px 0px"}},[(0,i.Lk)("h1",{class:"ProjectTitle",style:{margin:"25px 0px 25px 0px"}},"Publications"),(0,i.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"I Can Embrace and Avoid Vagueness Myself: Supporting the Design Process by Balancing Vagueness through Text-to-Image Generative AI"),(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperAuthors"},[(0,i.Lk)("span",{class:"PaperName"},"Myungjin Kim"),(0,i.eW)(", Bogoan Kim, Kyungsik Han")]),(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{margin:"0px 0px 0px 0px"}},"Arxiv Preprint"),(0,i.Lk)("p",{class:"PdfLink"},[(0,i.Lk)("span",{style:{cursor:"pointer","text-decoration":"underline"},OnClick:"window.open('https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/CLAY.pdf', '_blank')"},"PDF")])])],-1),o=[n,r];function p(e,s,t,n,r,p){return(0,i.uX)(),(0,i.CE)("div",a,o)}var c=t(3497),d=t.n(c),l={name:"MyProjectsdetail4",components:{},props:{msg:String},setup(){(0,i.sV)((()=>{d().init()}))}},g=t(1241);const h=(0,g.A)(l,[["render",p]]);var u=h}}]);
