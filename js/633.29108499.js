We also employed the k-means algorithm to allow users to quickly explore and create their own style board that incorporates brand identity, trends, and user preferences (Pick). In CoDesign, we used StyleGAN2 to generate images that are consistent with the style board and different from existing designs (Create). We also implemented StyleGAN2-based style mixing, interpolation, and attribute editing to integrate the fashion designerâ€™s unique style (Switch). In CoImprovement, we used Transformer embedding vectors to recommend images based on overall looks and the style board (View). Additionally, we employed an attribute detection model to recommend images based on attributes and the style board (Fit). From this, designers can easily think of various ways to improve designs that also fit with the style board.
