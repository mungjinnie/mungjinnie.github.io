Vagueness refers to ideas beginning as uncertain and abstract mental images. This vagueness allows for multiple interpretations, fosters the transformation of ideas, and preventing early fixation. However, when vagueness becomes excessive, it can lead to scattered or directionless outcomes due to a lack of clear constraints in the creative process. Therefore, effectively managing vagueness is crucial to the success of a project. <br><br>We propose CLAY, an interactive system that supports the effective management of vagueness.</span></p></div><div class="container3" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer" style="width:90%;"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/CLAY3.png" class="Pprojectimage4"></div></div><div class="Projectdescription" style="margin:50px 0px 0px 0px;"><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">Vagueness Balancing Process</h1><p class="PTexts"><span style="font-weight:400;">We focused on the fashion design domain and conducted a formative study with six fashion designers. Based on the study, we identified the process of balancing vagueness in fashion design. The diagram illustrates the structure of the vagueness balancing process in two stages of the fashion design: the moodboard stage and the fashion design stage. For each stage, when the process begins, fashion designers embrace vagueness by exploring the hierarchical structure. As they progress through the process, fashion designers avoid vagueness by combining these hierarchical elements. </span></p></div><div class="container3" style="margin:-40px 0px 80px 0px;"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer" style="width:90%;"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/CLAY4.png" class="Pprojectimage4"></div></div><div class="Projectdescription" style="margin:50px 0px 0px 0px;"><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">CLAY</h1><p class="PTexts"><span style="font-weight:400;"> The user starts by composing a &quot;vague prompt,&quot; and users explore the hierarchical keyword results generated by the text-to-image generative AI. The user then refines the prompt using the keywords provided by CLAY, avoiding vagueness. Next, CLAY generates the combination results from the keyword user input. </span></p></div><div class="container3" style="margin:-30px 0px 80px 0px;"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer" style="width:100%;"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/CLAY6.png" class="Pprojectimage4"></div></div><div class="Projectdescription" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;"><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">Impact</h1><p class="PTexts"><span style="font-weight:400;"> From the user study, we found that users independently embraced and avoided vagueness when using CLAY. This study highlights that, on an interactive interface, simply displaying the AI output in alignment with users&#39; cognitive processes can significantly enhance usability. Our research offers valuable insights for designing AI systems that assist users in fields where balancing vagueness plays a critical role in creative process. </span></p></div><div class="Projectdescription" style="margin:30px 0px 0px 0px;"><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">Key Responsibilities</h1><p class="PTexts"><span style="font-weight:400;"> - Conducted a formative study with 6 fashion designers and set system design goals. <br> - Developed the CLAY, an interactive system leveraging text-to-image Generative AI prompting method. <br> - Conducted a user study with 10 fashion designers to evaluate the effectiveness of CLAY. <br> - Derived meaningful findings from log, survey, and interview data and suggested system design implications. <br> - Led the paper writing process from draft to publication.</span></p></div>',8),r=(0,a.Lk)("div",{class:"Projectdescription",style:{margin:"50px 0px 0px 0px"}},[(0,a.Lk)("h1",{class:"ProjectTitle",style:{margin:"25px 0px 25px 0px"}},"Publications"),(0,a.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,a.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"I Can Embrace and Avoid Vagueness Myself: Supporting the Design Process by Balancing Vagueness through Text-to-Image Generative AI"),(0,a.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperAuthors"},[(0,a.Lk)("span",{class:"PaperName"},"Myungjin Kim"),(0,a.eW)(", Bogoan Kim, Kyungsik Han")]),(0,a.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{margin:"0px 0px 0px 0px"}},"Arxiv Preprint"),(0,a.Lk)("p",{class:"PdfLink"},[(0,a.Lk)("span",{style:{cursor:"pointer","text-decoration":"underline"},OnClick:"window.open('https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/CLAY.pdf', '_blank')"},"PDF")])])],-1),o=[n,r];function c(e,s,t,n,r,c){return(0,a.uX)(),(0,a.CE)("div",i,o)}var p=t(3497),l=t.n(p),g={name:"MyProjectsdetail4",components:{},props:{msg:String},setup(){(0,a.sV)((()=>{l().init()}))}},d=t(1241);const h=(0,d.A)(g,[["render",c]]);var u=h}}]);
