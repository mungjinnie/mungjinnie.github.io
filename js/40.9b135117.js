However, vintage goods are often perceived as old-fashioned and appealing only to a niche market. I believed that if vintage items were presented as fashionable and trendy, they could attract a much broader range of consumers. To put this idea into action, I launched Lose Your Cool, a second-hand online store. I managed various tasks, including sourcing products by visiting second-hand apparel distributors, curating selections, and creating visual content to engage customers. <br><br> This project has the potential to reshape perceptions of second-hand clothing, driving changes in consumer behavior and increasing awareness of sustainable fashion. </span></p></div><div class="container3_1"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer_1"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/loseyourcool.jpg" class="Pprojectimage1"></div><div class="Psubprojectcontainer_1"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/fashion1.jpg" class="Pprojectimage1"></div><div class="Psubprojectcontainer_1"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/fashion2.jpg" class="Pprojectimage1"></div></div><div class="container3_1"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer_1"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/LYC_1.jpg" class="Pprojectimage1"></div><div class="Psubprojectcontainer_1"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/LYC_2.jpg" class="Pprojectimage1"></div><div class="Psubprojectcontainer_1"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/LYC_3.jpg" class="Pprojectimage1"></div></div><div class="Projectdescription" style="margin:100px 0px 0px 0px;"><h1 class="ProjectTitle">Recycling: Eyes Magazine X Adidas</h1><p class="PTexts"><span style="font-weight:400;">I collaborated with Eyes magazine and Adidas to transform Adidas soccer uniforms into new, stylish products.
