Rather than rejecting and denying new opportunities that AI can provide, collaborating with AI can further foster human creativity.</p><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">Formative Study</h1><p class="PTexts">To build an AI driven creativity support system, we conducted formative study. <br>First, we identified the fashion creativty process: <br>- When a brand’s new season concept is set, designers investigate various images that match the brand identity and reflect the trend. <br> - Designers create new products that match the styleboard. <br> - Sample clothes are produced based on the images selected in the design phase, and the modification of clothes is continuously repeated. <br><br> We interviewed six fashion professionals about the real-life processes, challenges, and possible solutions at each stage. We found a key challenge in each of the three design processes, and based on these, three design goals were established: <br> - The need to find images that contain the designer’s perspectives, brand identity, and trends. <br> - The need to provide an image inspiration that differentiates between an existing design and the designer’s past design. <br> - The need to improved references without deviating from the mood initially set.</p><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">Design Goals</h1><p class="PTexts">Based on the interview results, we identified the three design goals and AI requirements <br>- Creates a styleboard that reflects all brand identities, trends, and designer’s styles. <br>- Provides new design inspiration that is different from existing designs. <br>- Recommends various ways to improve designs and attributes. </p><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">System Development</h1><p class="PTexts">Based on these design goals, we developed CoFashion (Co-Create Fashion) which has a total of three processes. We finetuned <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">StyleGAN2</span> and <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">Transformer</span> with 40,000 fashion image dataset collected from Vogue.com. To extract 46 fashion categories and 294 fashion design attributes, we used attribute detection model Swin-B as the backbone to train the attribute Mask R-CNN using the Fashionpedia dataset. </p></div><div class="container3" style="margin:50px 0px 0px 0px;"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/CoCoStyle1.png" class="Pprojectimage4"><p class="Pprojecttext">The user constrains a baseline to form a style board and selects designer own mood board.</p></div><div class="Psubprojectcontainer"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/CoCoStyle2.png" class="Pprojectimage4"><p class="Pprojecttext">The user generates an image based on the style board and adjusts the generated image.</p></div><div class="Psubprojectcontainer"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/CoCoStyle3.png" class="Pprojectimage4"><p class="Pprojecttext">The user obtains improvement directions based on the style board and the attribute.</p></div></div><div class="Projectdescription" style="margin:60px 0px 0px 0px;"><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">User Study &amp; Data Analysis</h1><p class="PTexts">We conducted a user study with a total of <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">30 participants</span>, including fashion designers working in fashion companies or students majoring in fashion. We <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">analysed survey responses and system usage logs</span> and conducted <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">inductive thematic analysis</span> with the interviews.

It focuses on <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">identifying pain points and addressing the fashion industry&#39;s challenges using AI</span>. Unlike traditional developer-focused AI research, <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">MOS emphasizes solving problems in the fashion industry using AI,</span> with a human-centered AI approach. MOS aims to make design systems and servies accessible and beneficial to fashion professionals and enhance the user shopping experience. MOS focuses on developing two key technologies and systems: <br><br>- An recommendation system that that goes beyond analyzing web shopping mall log data (clicks, shopping cart, likes). Mos aims to offer highly personalized <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">recommendations to new web shopping mall visitors who do not have any log data</span>. <br>- A system that leverages AI technology for generating descriptions by LLMs from fashion images and extracting attributes. We aims to <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">quickly and accurately analyse fashion trends</span>, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating AI technology into the fashion industry. <br><br> <span style="font-weight:500;">Key Responsibilities</span><br><br> - Developed an API for extracting color attributes from fashion images using the U2NET and color extract Python module <br> - Developed an API for generating fake images by fine-tuning StyleGAN2 with a dataset of 40,000 fashion images crawled from Vogue. <br> - Developed an API for style trend analysis using the algorithm that received the highest satisfaction from users for clustering styles and analyzing trends. <br> - Developed a crawling API that continuously collects data on newly updated fashion products. <br> - Designed interface that provides a unified look to dashboard components and shapes, enhancing user experience and actively incorporating user feedback. <br> - Designed a exhibition booth that aligns with the MOS brand identity and captures attention. </p></div><div class="Projectdescription" style="margin:60px 0px 0px 0px;"><h1 class="ProjectTitle" style="font-size:16px;">System Design</h1><p class="PTexts"> - Developed a dashboard that <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">allows professionals to easily access a numerous amount of scattered fashion images</span>. Users can filter images by year, season, color, category, and attributes. A study involving 166 participants, including fashion industry professionals, designers, and general user groups, evaluated preferences among the algorithms. <br> - Created a service that <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">analyzes consumer&#39;s preference and recommends items based on their Instagram feeds, once linked with a shopping mall</span>. Fashion professionals can view the analysis of purchase histories and preferred styles of consumers who have linked their Instagram accounts, through the dashboard. <br> - Designed a dashboard supporting <span style="background-color:#E5ECF1;">fashion merchandiser&#39;s copywriting tasks and fashion designer&#39;s creative processes by an LLM (Large Language Model)</span>. When users input specific attributes, the system generates detailed descriptions and images containing those details. </p></div><div class="container3" style="margin:50px 0px 0px 0px;"><div class="Psubprojectcontainer"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/MOS1.png" class="Pprojectimage4"></div><div class="Psubprojectcontainer"><img src="https://about-homepage.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/MOS2.png" class="Pprojectimage4"></div></div>',6),o=(0,t.Lk)("div",{class:"Projectdescription",style:{margin:"10px 0px 0px 0px"}},[(0,t.Lk)("h1",{class:"ProjectTitle",style:{margin:"25px 0px 25px 0px"}},"Publications"),(0,t.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"Under Review: Understanding the Differences in an AI Mixed Initiative Co-Creative System Between Creativity Types in Fashion Design"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperAuthors"},[(0,t.Lk)("span",{class:"PaperName"},"Myungjin Kim"),(0,t.eW)(", Misun Joo, Kyungsik Han")]),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{margin:"0px 0px 30px 0px"}},"CSCW 2024: ACM International Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing")]),(0,t.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"Under Review: CoCoStyle: Mixed Initiative Co-Creative System to Support Creative Process of Fashion Design"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperAuthors"},[(0,t.Lk)("span",{class:"PaperName"},"Myungjin Kim"),(0,t.eW)(", Misun Joo, Kyungsik Han")]),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{margin:"0px 0px 30px 0px"}},"SoftwareX")]),(0,t.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"A Study on User Perception and Experience Differences in Recommendation Results by Domain Expertise: The case of Fashion Domains"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperAuthors"},[(0,t.eW)("Taehyung Noh, Haein Yeo, "),(0,t.Lk)("span",{class:"PaperName"},"Myungjin Kim"),(0,t.eW)(", Kyungsik Han")]),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference"},"CHI LBW 2023: ACM International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PdfLink"},[(0,t.Lk)("span",{style:{cursor:"pointer","text-decoration":"underline"},OnClick:"location.href='https://astlyi.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/2023/%5B99%5DA+Study+on+User+Perception+and+Experience+Differences+in+Recommendation+Results+by+Domain+Expertise.pdf'"},"PDF")])]),(0,t.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"CoFashion: An AI Web Interface Enhancing Creative Thinking for Fashion Designers"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperAuthors",style:{top:"18px"}},[(0,t.eW)("Misun Joo, "),(0,t.Lk)("span",{class:"PaperName"},"Myungjin Kim"),(0,t.eW)(", Bogoan Kim, Kyungsik Han")]),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{top:"37px"}},"Korea Software Congress 2023"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PdfLink"},[(0,t.Lk)("span",{style:{cursor:"pointer","text-decoration":"underline"},OnClick:"location.href='https://astlyi.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/2023/%5BD-35%5DCoFashion.pdf'"},"PDF")])]),(0,t.Lk)("h1",{class:"ProjectTitle",style:{margin:"25px 0px 25px 0px"}},"Awards & Accomplishments"),(0,t.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"2022 Best Inventor award"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{margin:"0px 0px 30px 0px"}},"Seoul International Invention Fair")]),(0,t.Lk)("h1",{class:"ProjectTitle",style:{margin:"25px 0px 25px 0px"}},"Patents"),(0,t.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"Interacting with fashion image analysis, recommendation, and generation AI technology to support the fashion design process (Filed, 10-2023-0188413)"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{margin:"0px 0px 30px 0px"}},"Patents")]),(0,t.Lk)("div",{class:"Paper"},[(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"PaperTitle"},"AI Software Supporting Fashion Designer Creativity (Filed, C-2024-004375)"),(0,t.Lk)("p",{class:"Conference",style:{margin:"0px 0px 30px 0px"}},"Software")])],-1),r=[i,o];function p(e,s,a,i,o,p){return(0,t.uX)(),(0,t.CE)("div",n,r)}var c=a(3497),l=a.n(c),d={name:"MyProjectsdetail4",components:{},props:{msg:String},setup(){(0,t.sV)((()=>{l().init()}))}},h=a(1241);const g=(0,h.A)(d,[["render",p]]);var u=g}}]);
